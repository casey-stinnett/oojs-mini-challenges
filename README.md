Workshop - OO JavaScript Mini Challenges: Individual
Goal:

To provide practice using object oriented javascript techniques in real world scenarios.

Assignment:

Complete the following programming problems

Create an object called Multiplier with two methods: multiply and getCurrentValue. multiply should initially return the number supplied * 1 and from then on whatever the current value is times the number supplied.getCurrentValue should return the last answer returned from multiply.

Create an Album object that can contain many Photo objects in its photos attribute. Each Album should allow you to add a new Photo, list all Photos, and access a specific Photo by the order it was added. Each Photo should store the photo's file name (location) and the location the photo was taken in as strings. Create instances of each object defined to prove that your object model works.

Create a Library object that holds Book objects. The Library object can retrieve a book by title, allows you to add a new Book, will get rid of a book by title, and will give you a count of how many books are in the library. Each Book holds a title, author, and genre. Create instances of each object defined to prove that your objects and their methods work.
Advanced:

Create a prototypical Person object. From this object, extend a Teacher object and a Student object. Each of these objects should have attributes and methods pertinent to what they describe. Also create a School object that should be able to store instances of students and teachers. Make sure to write code afterwards that creates instances of these objects to make sure that what you've written works well and you're able to store the necessary data in each object.

Give the school the ability to hire new teachers, and take on more students. This will be done with one method of school, not two. This method will add teachers to the list of teachers, and students to the list of students.
Extra Challenge: If you have time and are looking for an extra challenge try using your solution to problem 2 to create a simple one page photo gallery. This page should display all photos stored in your photo gallery object. Try your best to implement modern design trends and if you are looking for even more then give a user the option to press a button to animate the images on the page somehow. Have fun!

Grading Criteria:

Code has a comment that notes which problem the code snippet is attempting to solve.
All solutions should explicitly fulfill the requirements noted in each problem.
Complete = Meets ALL grading criteria points above.

Incomplete = Does not meet all grading criteria points above. Needs improvement or missing submission.
